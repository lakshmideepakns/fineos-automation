Exercise 1 – Test Scenario Definition 
Imagine that the application has just been deployed for the first time, so that there are neither previous existing tests nor scenarios.
Define the set of test scenarios that you would choose to test the application. In a 2 – week sprint, which scenarios of that set would you test manually, and which ones would you automate, and why?
Using the formula Given-When-Then would be ideal. 
Document the test plan and make it available to us before Monday, March 24th 11:00 am GMT..
(ideally, include the answers to exercise 1 in the same GitHub repository as exercise 2).

Exercise 2 – Sample scenario test automation
Using the IDE of your preference, automate in selenium webdriver java with TestNG the following scenario:
1-	Navigate to www.demoblaze.com
2-	Navigate to phones and choose one of them to buy. Get its price.
3-	Navigate to Laptops and add one of the laptops to the shopping cart. Get its price.
4-	Navigate to Monitors, add one of them to the cart. Get its price.
5-	Go to the shopping cart and remove the phone.
6-	Place the order.
7-	Check that your purchase has been successful, with the correct amount, and get its purchase id.

Print to pdf the TestNG report with the result of your test execution, be it successful or failing.
And the delivery of this exercise must be including some minimal step-by-step instructions explaining how to install, configure, and how to run the selenium using a typical IDE, so that we can check ourselves the execution. Java Selenium project must be Java 8 compliant 
Please, upload both your test code and the test execution report to a GitHub repository, and give us access to it before Monday, March 24th 11:00 am GMT.
